# Building a Streaming Classification Server Action

This tutorial provides a detailed explanation of how to implement a server action that streams classification results from a large language model (LLM). We'll use LangChain and OpenAI to create a real-time, streaming classification system.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:

- Next.js 14 or later installed (for server actions support)
- Node.js 18 or later
- An OpenAI API key
- Basic understanding of TypeScript and async programming
- LangChain packages installed:
  - `@langchain/openai`
  - `@langchain/core`

## Understanding Server Actions

Server Actions are a feature in Next.js that allows you to define asynchronous functions that execute on the server. They're perfect for:

- Processing data before sending it to the client
- Interacting with external APIs securely (hiding API keys)
- Performing computations that would be too intensive for the client

By marking a function with the `'use server'` directive, you're telling Next.js that this function should only run on the server, even if it's imported into client components.

## Understanding Streaming Responses

Streaming responses allow you to send data to the client gradually as it becomes available, instead of waiting for the entire response to be ready. This is particularly useful when:

- Working with LLMs that generate text token by token
- Providing real-time feedback to users
- Reducing perceived latency in applications

The Web Streams API (`ReadableStream`) is used to create streaming responses.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

First, let's create a file named `classification-action.ts` in the `server` directory:
